## Projects Overview

Each project in this repository covers core backend development concepts like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, user authentication, database management, and building REST APIs. The projects use Node.js, Express.js, and in some cases, PostgreSQL as the database.

## Prerequisites

Before running any of these projects, you will need to have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- (Optional) [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) if the project requires a database

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ulyk04/backend_projects.git
    cd backend_projects
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder you want to explore.

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Follow the specific setup instructions for each project (see [Project Descriptions](#project-descriptions)).

## Project Descriptions

### 1. Simple REST API

This project is a basic REST API built with Node.js and Express. It demonstrates how to create routes, handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and return responses.

- **Technologies:** Node.js, Express , jsonwebtoken , bcrypt , body-parser , readline-sync and more
- **Features:**
  - Simple routing
  - CRUD operations for a sample resource
  - No database is used, data is stored in-memory
  - Basic game in node.js
